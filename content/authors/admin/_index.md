# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: Dr Wanting Jiao’s area of expertise is computational biochemistry and biophysics. She studies protein-ligand interactions, protein function and regulation using computational techniques and relating results from computational calculations to experimental results. She says this combination of techniques offers a powerful approach towards investigating behaviours of protein systems.

Wanting’s current research uses molecular modelling techniques including molecular dynamics simulations, QM/MM calculations, ligand docking, structure-based virtual screening, homology modelling and bioinformatics.

Wanting received her PhD in Chemistry from the University of Canterbury.
